Electronic health record-based decision support to improve asthma care: a cluster-randomized trial,"Bell, L. M.; Grundmeier, R.; Localio, R.; Zorc, J.; Fiks, A. G.; Zhang, X.; Stephens, T. B.; Swietlik, M.; Guevara, J. P.","OBJECTIVE: Asthma continues to be 1 of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and affects approximately 6 million US children. Although National Asthma Education Prevention Program guidelines exist and are widely accepted, previous studies have demonstrated poor clinician adherence across a variety of populations. We sought to determine if clinical decision support (CDS) embedded in an electronic health record (EHR) would improve clinician adherence to national asthma guidelines in the primary care setting.METHODS: We conducted a prospective cluster-randomized trial in 12 primary care sites over a 1-year period. Practices were stratified for analysis according to whether the site was urban or suburban. Children aged 0 to 18 years with persistent asthma were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes for asthma. The 6 intervention-practice sites had CDS alerts imbedded in the EHR. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of children with at least 1 prescription for controller medication, an up-to-date asthma care plan, and the performance of office-based spirometry.RESULTS: Increases in the number of prescriptions for controller medications, over time, was 6% greater (P = .006) and 3% greater for spirometry (P = .04) in the intervention urban practices. Filing an up-to-date asthma care plan improved 14% (P = .03) and spirometry improved 6% (P = .003) in the suburban practices with the intervention.CONCLUSION: In our study, using a cluster-randomized trial design, CDS in the EHR, at the point of care, improved clinician compliance with National Asthma Education Prevention Program guidelines.",2010,Apr,Pediatrics,125,4,e770-7,20231191,http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2009-1385,"",Bell 2010,Pepijn Looije (2016-04-06 19:16:47)(Select): Waarschijnlijk inclusie.

A computerized decision support system for ovarian stimulation by gonadotropins,"Lesourd, F.; Avril, C.; Boujennah, A.; Parinaud, J.","Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized decision support system for ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. Design: Retrospective and prospective randomized studies. Setting: Private and university teaching hospital. Patient(s): Women undergoing ovarian stimulation to treat infertility. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pregnancy rate. Result(s): In the retrospective study, computer-generated decisions were compared with clinicians' decisions in 118 stimulated cycles in 53 patients. In 90% of cases, the choice of FSH regimens and adjustments to dosages were identical. In the prospective study, the computer-generated decisions achieved a pregnancy rate per cycle of 18% (15 of 82 cycles), compared with 16% (13 of 82 cycles) achieved by clinicians. Conclusion(s): A computerized decision making system was as effective as skilled clinicians in achieving pregnancy by using ovarian stimulation with FSH. (Fertil Steril(R) 2002;77:456-60.

Computed critiquing integrated into daily clinical practice affects physicians' behavior - A randomized clinical trial with AsthmaCritic,"Kuilboer, M. M.; van Wijk, M. A. M.; Mosseveld, M.; van der Does, E.; de Jongste, J. C.; Overbeek, S. E.; Ponsioen, B.; van der Lei, J.","Objective: We developed AsthmaCritic, a non-inquisitive critiquing system integrated with the general practitioners' electronic medical records. The system is based on the guidelines for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. This paper assesses the effect of AsthmaCritic on monitoring and treatment of asthma and COPD by Dutch general practitioners in daily practice. Methods: A randomized clinical trial in 32 practices (40 Dutch general practitioners) using electronic patient records. An intervention group was given the use of AsthmaCritic, a control group continued working in the usual manner. Both groups had the disposal of the asthma and COPD guidelines routinely distributed by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. We measured the average number of contacts, FEV1 (forced expiratory volume), and peak-flow measurements per asthma/COPD patient per practice, and, the average number of antihistamine, cromoglycate, deptropine, and oral bronchodilator prescriptions per asthma/COPD patient per practice. Results: The number of contacts increased in the age group of 12-39 years. The number of FEV1, peak-flow measurements, and the ratio of coded measurements increased, whereas the number of cromoglycate prescriptions decreased in the age group of 12-39 years. Conclusions: Our study shows that the guideline-based critiquing system AsthmaCritic changed the manner in which the physicians monitored their patients and, to a lesser extent, their treatment behaviour. In addition, the physicians changed their data recording habits.",2006,2006,Methods of Information in Medicine,45,4,447-454,WOS:000239824800019,"","",Kuilboer 2006,""

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of computer-based cardiac care suggestions. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial targeting primary care physicians and pharmacists. SUBJECTS: A total of 706 outpatients with heart failure and/or ischemic heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Evidence-based cardiac care suggestions, approved by a panel of local cardiologists and general internists, were displayed to physicians and pharmacists as they cared for enrolled patients. MEASUREMENTS: Adherence with the care suggestions, generic and condition-specific quality of life, acute exacerbations of their cardiac disease, medication compliance, health care costs, satisfaction with care, and physicians' attitudes toward guidelines. RESULTS: Subjects were followed for 1 year during which they made 3,419 primary care visits and were eligible for 2,609 separate cardiac care suggestions. The intervention had no effect on physicians' adherence to the care suggestions (23% for intervention patients vs 22% for controls). There were no intervention-control differences in quality of life, medication compliance, health care utilization, costs, or satisfaction with care. Physicians viewed guidelines as providing helpful information but constraining their practice and not helpful in making decisions for individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: Care suggestions generated by a sophisticated electronic medical record system failed to improve adherence to accepted practice guidelines or outcomes for patients with heart disease.

A randomized trial of electronic clinical reminders to improve quality of care for diabetes and coronary artery disease,"Sequist, T. D.; Gandhi, T. K.; Karson, A. S.; Fiskio, J. M.; Bugbee, D.; Sperling, M.; Cook, E. F.; Orav, E. J.; Fairchild, D. G.; Bates, D. W.","Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of an integrated patient-specific electronic clinical reminder system on diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) care and to assess physician attitudes toward this reminder system. Design: We enrolled 194 primary care physicians caring for 4549 patients with diabetes and 2199 patients with CAD at 20 ambulatory clinics. Clinics were randomized so that physicians received either evidence-based electronic reminders within their patients' electronic medical record or usual care. There were five reminders for diabetes care and four reminders for CAD care. Measurements: The primary outcome was receipt of recommended care for diabetes and CAD. We created a summary outcome to assess the odds of increased compliance with overall diabetes care (based on five measures) and overall CAD care (based on four measures). We surveyed physicians to assess attitudes toward the reminder system. Results: Baseline adherence rates to all quality measures were low. While electronic reminders increased the odds of recommended diabetes care (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.67) and CAD (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.01-1.55), the impact of individual reminders was variable. A total of three of nine reminders effectively increased rates of recommended care for diabetes or CAD. The majority of physicians (76%) thought that reminders improved quality of care. Conclusion: An integrated electronic reminder system resulted in variable improvement in care for diabetes and CAD.

Failure of computerized treatment suggestions to improve health outcomes of outpatients with uncomplicated hypertension: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Murray, M. D.; Harris, L. E.; Overhage, J. M.; Zhou, X. H.; Eckert, G. J.; Smith, F. E.; Buchanan, N. N.; Wolinsky, F. D.; McDonald, C. J.; Tierney, W. M.","Study Objective. To assess the effects of evidence-based treatment suggestions for hypertension made to physicians and pharmacists using a comprehensive electronic medical record system. Design. Randomized controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of physician and pharmacist interventions, which resulted in four groups of patients: physician intervention only, pharmacist intervention only, intervention by physician and pharmacist, and intervention by neither physician nor pharmacist (control). Setting. Academic primary care internal medicine practice. Subjects. Seven hundred twelve patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Measurements and Main Results. Suggestions were displayed to physicians on computer workstations used to write outpatient orders and to pharmacists when filling prescriptions. The primary end point was generic health-related quality of life. Secondary end points were symptom profile and side effects from antihypertensive drugs, number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, patient satisfaction with physicians and pharmacists, drug therapy compliance, and health care charges. In the control group, implementation of care changes in accordance with treatment suggestions was observed in 26% of patients. In the intervention groups, compliance with suggestions was poor, with treatment suggestions implemented in 25% of patients for whom suggestions were displayed only to pharmacists, 29% of those for whom suggestions were displayed only to physicians, and 35% of the group for whom both physicians and pharmacists received suggestions (p=0.13). Intergroup differences were neither statistically significant nor clinically relevant for generic health-related quality of life, symptom and side-effect profiles, number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations, blood pressure measurements, charges, or drug therapy compliance.

Lessons from a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate computer decision support software to improve the management of asthma,"McCowan, C.; Neville, R. G.; Ricketts, I. W.; Warner, F. C.; Hoskins, G.; Thomas, G. E.","Primary objective: To investigate whether computer decision support software used in the management of patients with asthma improves clinical outcomes. Research design: Randomized controlled trial with practices each reporting on 30 patients with asthma over a 6 month period. Methods and procedures: 447 patients were randomly selected from practice asthma registers managed by 17 general practices from throughout the UK. Intervention practices used the software during consultations with these patients throughout the study while control practices did not. Main outcomes and results: Practice consultations, acute exacerbations of asthma, hospital contacts, symptoms on assessment and medication use. A smaller proportion of patients within the intervention group initiated practice consultations for their asthma: 34 (22%) vs 111 (34%), odds ratio (OR)=0.59, 95%, confidence interval (CI) (0.37-0.95); and suffered acute asthma exacerbations: 12 (8%) vs 57 (17%), OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.21-0.85 six months after the introduction of the computer decision support software. There were no discernable differences in reported symptoms, maintenance prescribing or use of hospital services between the two groups. Conclusion: The use of computer decision support software that implements guidelines during patient consultations may improve clinical outcomes for patients with asthma.",2001,Jul-Sep,Medical Informatics and the Internet in Medicine,26,3,191-201,WOS:000171878100004,"","",McCowan 2001,""
A computerized reminder system to increase the use of preventive care for hospitalized patients,"Dexter, P. R.; Perkins, S.; Overhage, J. M.; Maharry, K.; Kohler, R. B.; McDonald, C. J.","Background: Although they are effective in outpatient settings, computerized reminders have not been proved to increase preventive care in inpatient settings. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects of computerized reminders on the rates at which four preventive therapies were ordered for inpatients. During an 18-month study period, a computerized system processed on-line information for all 6371 patients admitted to a general-medicine service (for a total of 10,065 hospitalizations), generating preventive care reminders as appropriate. Physicians who were in the intervention group viewed these reminders when they were using a computerized order-entry system for inpatients. Results: The reminder system identified 3416 patients (53.6 percent) as eligible for preventive measures that had not been ordered by the admitting physician. For patients with at least one indication, computerized reminders resulted in higher adjusted ordering rates for pneumococcal vaccination (35.8 percent of the patients in the intervention group vs. 0.8 percent of those in the control group, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (51.4 percent vs. 1.0 percent, P< 0.001), prophylactic heparin (32.2 percent vs. 18.9 percent, P<0.001), and prophylactic aspirin at discharge (36.4 percent vs. 27.6 percent, P<0.001). Conclusions: A majority of hospitalized patients in this study were eligible for preventive measures, and computerized reminders significantly increased the rate of delivery of such therapies.

A randomized trial of ''corollary orders'' to prevent errors of omission,"Overhage, J. M.; Tierney, W. M.; Zhou, X. H.; McDonald, C. J.","Objective: Errors of omission are a common cause of systems failures. Physicians often fail to order tests or treatments needed to monitor/ameliorate the effects of other tests or treatments. The authors hypothesized that automated, guideline-based reminders to physicians, provided as they wrote orders, could reduce these omissions. Design: The study was performed on the inpatient general medicine ward of a public teaching hospital. Faculty and housestaff from the Indiana University School of Medicine, who used computer workstations to write orders, were randomized to intervention and control groups. As intervention physicians wrote orders for 1 of 87 selected tests or treatments, the computer suggested corollary orders needed to detect or ameliorate adverse reactions to the trigger orders. The physicians could accept or reject these suggestions. Results: During the 6-month trial, reminders about corollary orders were-presented to 48 intervention physicians and withheld from 41 control physicians. intervention physicians ordered the suggested corollary orders in 46.3% of instances when they received a reminder, compared with 21.9% compliance by control physicians (p < 0.0001). Physicians discriminated in their acceptance of suggested orders, readily accepting some while rejecting others. There were one third fewer interventions initiated by pharmacists with physicians in the intervention than control groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that physician workstations, linked to a comprehensive electronic medical record, can be an efficient means for decreasing errors of omissions and improving adherence to practice guidelines.",1997,Sep-Oct,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,4,5,364-375,WOS:A1997XV20800005,"","",Overhage 1997,""
