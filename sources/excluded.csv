Impact of a computerized template on antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in children and adolescents,"Bourgeois, F. C.; Linder, J.; Johnson, S. A.; Co, J. P.; Fiskio, J.; Ferris, T. G.","BACKGROUND: Computerized decision support (CDS) can potentially improve patient safety and guideline adherence. The authors developed an acute respiratory illness interactive template (ARI-IT) within an electronic health record (EHR) to manage pediatric ARIs and assessed the impact on antibiotic prescribing.METHODS: They randomized 12 practices either to receive the ARI-IT or to the control group. Antibiotic rates among all eligible ARI diagnoses were compared among control and intervention ARI visits, controlling for clustering by clinician.RESULTS: There was no difference in total antibiotic prescriptions between control and intervention clinics. Use of the ARI-IT significantly reduced antibiotic prescriptions (31.7% vs 39.9%; P = .02) and use of macrolides (6.2% vs 9.5%; P = .02) among visits compared with those eligible visits where it was not used.CONCLUSION: Use of the CDS reduced antibiotic prescribing and macrolide prescriptions among children with an ARI. Nonetheless, the low overall use resulted in an ineffective intervention.",2010,Oct,Clinical Pediatrics,49,10,976-83,20724348,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0009922810373649,"",Bourgeois 2010,Exclusion reason: Not multi-faceted; 
Randomized trial of a computerized coronary heart disease risk assessment tool in HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy,"Bucher, H.

Cohort Study","BACKGROUND: Exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can lead to important metabolic changes and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Computerized clinical decision support systems have been advocated to improve the management of patients at risk for CHD but it is unclear whether such systems reduce patients' risk for CHD.METHODS: We conducted a cluster trial within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) of HIV-infected patients, aged 18 years or older, not pregnant and receiving cART for >3 months. We randomized 165 physicians to either guidelines for CHD risk factor management alone or guidelines plus CHD risk profiles. Risk profiles included the Framingham risk score, CHD drug prescriptions and CHD events based on biannual assessments, and were continuously updated by the SHCS data centre and integrated into patient charts by study nurses. Outcome measures were total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and Framingham risk score.RESULTS: A total of 3,266 patients (80% of those eligible) had a final assessment of the primary outcome at least 12 months after the start of the trial. Mean (95% confidence interval) patient differences where physicians received CHD risk profiles and guidelines, rather than guidelines alone, were total cholesterol -0.02 mmol/l (-0.09-0.06), systolic blood pressure -0.4 mmHg (-1.6-0.8), diastolic blood pressure -0.4 mmHg (-1.5-0.7) and Framingham 10-year risk score -0.2% (-0.5-0.1).CONCLUSIONS: Systemic computerized routine provision of CHD risk profiles in addition to guidelines does not significantly improve risk factors for CHD in patients on cART.",2010,"",Antiviral Therapy,15,1,31-40,20167989,http://dx.doi.org/10.3851/IMP1475,"",Bucher 2010,Exclusion reason: Did not meet drug prescribing application criteria; 
C-reactive protein point-of-care testing for lower respiratory tract infections: a qualitative evaluation of experiences by GPs,"Cals, J. W.; Chappin, F. H.; Hopstaken, R. M.; van Leeuwen, M. E.; Hood, K.; Butler, C. C.; Dinant, G. J.","OBJECTIVES: To explore GPs' attitudes to and experiences of introducing C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing (POCT) for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in primary care.METHODS: Semi-structured interview study with 20 GPs who participated in the IMPAC(3)T randomized trial evaluating the effect of GP use of CRP POCT on management of LRTI. Main outcomes were GPs' experiences and views about CRP POCT in general practice, including its role in guiding antibiotic prescribing decisions and applicability and implementation in daily practice.RESULTS: GPs expressed mainly positive attitudes. Test results were rapidly available to support diagnostic and therapeutic processes for LRTI and other common infections, enhancing patient and GP confidence in prescribing decisions and empowering GPs to prescribe antibiotics less often. GPs were concerned about responding to ambiguous test results. They regarded financial reimbursement for using the test as essential for successful uptake.CONCLUSIONS: GPs were generally positive about CRP POCT, and they felt that it empowered them to safely prescribe fewer antibiotics for LRTI without alienating their patients. Successful wider implementation should address reimbursement and updating management guidelines to include the place of CRP POCT.",2010,Apr,Family Practice,27,2,212-8,20022909,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmp088,"",Cals 2010,Exclusion reason: Not RCT; 
Point-of-care C-reactive protein testing and antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infections: a randomized controlled trial,"Cals, J. W.; Schot, M. J.; de Jong, S. A.; Dinant, G. J.; Hopstaken, R. M.","PURPOSE: Antibiotics are only beneficial for subgroups of patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and rhinosinusitis in family practice, yet overprescribing for these conditions is common. C-reactive protein (CRP) point-of-care testing and delayed prescribing are useful strategies to reduce antibiotic prescribing, but both have limitations. We evaluated the effect of CRP assistance in antibiotic prescribing strategies-including delayed prescribing-in the management of LRTI and rhinosinusitis.METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which 258 patients were enrolled (107 LRTI and 151 rhinosinusitis) by 32 family physicians. Patients were individually randomized to CRP assistance or routine care (control). Primary outcome was antibiotic use after the index consultation. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic use during the 28-day follow-up, patient satisfaction, and clinical recovery.RESULTS: Patients in the CRP-assisted group used fewer antibiotics (43.4%) than control patients (56.6%) after the index consultation (relative risk [RR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.98). This difference remained significant during follow-up (52.7% vs 65.1%; RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99). Delayed prescriptions in the CRP-assisted group were filled only in a minority of cases (23% vs 72% in control group, P < .001). Recovery was similar across groups. Satisfaction with care was higher in patients managed with CRP assistance (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS: CRP point-of-care testing to assist in prescribing decisions, including delayed prescribing, for LRTI and rhinosinusitis may be a useful strategy to decrease antibiotic use and increase patient satisfaction without compromising patient recovery.",2010,Mar-Apr,Annals of Family Medicine,8,2,124-33,20212299,http://dx.doi.org/10.1370/afm.1090,"",Cals 2010,Exclusion reason: Did not evaluate CCDSS; 
The impact of an electronic monitoring and reminder device on patient compliance with antihypertensive therapy: a randomized controlled trial,"Christensen, A.; Christrup, L. L.; Fabricius, P. E.; Chrostowska, M.; Wronka, M.; Narkiewicz, K.; Hansen, E. H.","BACKGROUND: High blood pressure (BP) significantly increases overall cardiovascular risk, the incidence of ischemic heart disease and stroke. One of the most important causes of insufficient BP control is low treatment compliance. Reminders and electronic compliance monitoring have been shown to be effective in improving patient compliance to some extent, but the combined effect has not been documented.OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an electronic reminder and monitoring device on patient compliance and BP control.METHODS: All patients received medical treatment with telmisartan once daily and were randomized to either electronic compliance monitoring with a reminder and monitoring device or standard therapy for 6 months. Both groups were crossed over after 6 months. Intervention effectiveness was assessed using self-reported compliance and BP.RESULTS: Data from 398 patients were analysed. In the first half of the study, patients using the device reported 91% compliance versus 85% in the control group. This difference diminished after crossover (88 versus 86%). BP was not affected. Electronic monitoring data on compliance revealed taking, dosing and timing compliance between 45 and 52% in study group 1, and between 32 and 38% in study group 2.CONCLUSION: The Helping Hand reminder device was most suitable if used for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients, when it improved compliance by 6%. With the present medical treatment, the device does not have any influence on BP control, but with less forgiving medications, the device might make a significant difference.

"Antimicrobial stewardship: an evidence-based, antimicrobial self-assessment toolkit (ASAT) for acute hospitals","Cooke, J.; Alexander, K.; Charani, E.; Hand, K.; Hills, T.; Howard, P.; Jamieson, C.; Lawson, W.; Richardson, J.; Wade, P.","OBJECTIVES: To describe the methodology in developing an antimicrobial self-assessment toolkit (ASAT).METHODS: The ASAT was developed through a National Pharmacy Reference Group using an evidence-based approach of published information and national reports to identify criteria for inclusion. These were subdivided into domains that addressed: 1) Antimicrobial management within the Trust-structures and lines of responsibility and accountability-high-level notification to the Board. 2) Operational delivery of an antimicrobial strategy-operational standards of good antimicrobial stewardship. 3) Risk assessment for antimicrobial chemotherapy. 4) Clinical governance assurance. 5) Education and training-training needs and delivery of education and training for all who issue, prescribe and administer antimicrobials. 6) Antimicrobial pharmacist-systems in place for ensuring their optimum use. 7) Patients, Carers and the Public-information needs of patients, carers and the public.RESULTS: A web-based toolkit was developed using information from national reports and guidance on antimicrobial stewardship. The toolkit offers a checklist for hospitals to self-assess their organizations' levels of antimicrobial stewardship.CONCLUSIONS: The ASAT offers a web-enabled, version-controlled instrument for the assessment of antimicrobial stewardship in acute hospitals. It may offer a sensitive instrument to assess longitudinal progress on antimicrobial stewardship in an individual institution or act as a benchmark with similar organizations.

The impact of computerized provider order entry on medication errors in a multispecialty group practice,"Devine, E. B.; Hansen, R. N.; Wilson-Norton, J. L.; Lawless, N. M.; Fisk, A. W.; Blough, D. K.; Martin, D. P.; Sullivan, S. D.","OBJECTIVE: Computerized provider order entry (CPOE) has been shown to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and subsequent adverse drug events (ADEs). Studies demonstrating these benefits have been conducted primarily in the inpatient setting, with fewer in the ambulatory setting. The objective was to evaluate the effect of a basic, ambulatory CPOE system on medication errors and associated ADEs.DESIGN: This quasiexperimental, pretest-post-test study was conducted in a community-based, multispecialty health system not affiliated with an academic medical center. The intervention was a basic CPOE system with limited clinical decision support capabilities.MEASUREMENT: Comparison of prescriptions written before (n=5016 handwritten) to after (n=5153 electronically prescribed) implementation of the CPOE system. The primary outcome was the occurrence of error(s); secondary outcomes were types and severity of errors.RESULTS: Frequency of errors declined from 18.2% to 8.2%-a reduction in adjusted odds of 70% (OR: 0.30; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.40). The largest reductions were seen in adjusted odds of errors of illegibility (97%), use of inappropriate abbreviations (94%) and missing information (85%). There was a 57% reduction in adjusted odds of errors that did not cause harm (potential ADEs) (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.49). The reduction in the number of errors that caused harm (preventable ADEs) was not statistically significant, perhaps due to few errors in this category.CONCLUSIONS: A basic CPOE system in a community setting was associated with a significant reduction in medication errors of most types and severity levels.",2010,Jan-Feb,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,17,1,78-84,20064806,http://dx.doi.org/10.1197/jamia.M3285,"",Devine 2010,Exclusion reason: Not RCT; 
A Web-based clinical decision support system for depression care management,"Fortney, J. C.; Pyne, J. M.; Steven, C. A.; Williams, J. S.; Hedrick, R. G.; Lunsford, A. K.; Raney, W. N.; Ackerman, B. A.; Ducker, L. O.; Bonner, L. M.; Smith, J. L.","OBJECTIVE: To inform the design of future informatics systems that support the chronic care model.STUDY DESIGN: We describe the development and functionality of a decision support system for the chronic care model of depression treatment, known as collaborative care. Dissemination of evidence-based collaborative care models has been slow, and fidelity to the evidence base has been poor during implementation initiatives. Implementation could be facilitated by a decision support system for depression care managers, the cornerstone of the collaborative care model. The Net Decision Support System (https://www.netdss.net/) is a free Web-based system that was developed to support depression care manager activities and to facilitate the dissemination of collaborative care models that maintain high fidelity to the evidence base.METHODS: The NetDSS was based on intervention materials used for a randomized trial of depression care management that improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care. The NetDSS was developed jointly by a cross-functional design team of psychiatrists, depression care managers, information technology specialists, technical writers, and researchers.RESULTS: The NetDSS has the following functional capabilities: patient registry, patient encounter scheduler, trial management, clinical decision support, progress note generator, and workload and outcomes report generator. The NetDSS guides the care manager through a self-documenting patient encounter using evidence-based scripts and self-scoring instruments. The NetDSS has been used to provide evidence-based depression care management to more than 1700 primary care patients.CONCLUSION: Intervention protocols can be successfully converted to Web-based decision support systems that facilitate the implementation of evidence-based chronic care models into routine care with high fidelity.",2010,Nov,American Journal of Managed Care,16,11,849-54,21348556,"","",Fortney 2010,Exclusion reason: Not RCT;

A fast generalizable solution method for glucose control algorithms,"Hann, C. E.; Docherty, P.; Chase, J. G.; Shaw, G. M.","In critical care tight control of blood glucose levels has been shown to lead to better clinical outcomes. The need to develop new protocols for tight glucose control, as well as the opportunity to optimize a variety of other drug therapies, has led to resurgence in model-based medical decision support in this area. One still valid hindrance to developing new model-based protocols using so-called virtual patients, retrospective clinical data, and Monte Carlo methods is the large amount of computational time and resources needed. This paper develops fast analytical-based methods for insulin-glucose system model that are generalizable to other similar systems. Exploiting the structure and partial solutions in a subset of the model is the key in finding accurate fast solutions to the full model. This approach successfully reduced computing time by factors of 5600-144000 depending on the numerical error management method, for large (50-164 patients) virtual trials and Monte Carlo analysis. It thus allows new model-based or model-derived protocols to be rapidly developed via extensive simulation. The new method is rigorously compared to existing standard numerical solutions and is found to be highly accurate to within 0.2%.Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Using a clinical decision support system to determine the quality of antimicrobial dosing in intensive care patients with renal insufficiency,"Helmons, P. J.; Grouls, R. J.; Roos, A. N.; Bindels, A. J.; Wessels-Basten, S. J.; Ackerman, E. W.; Korsten, E. H.","BACKGROUND: The benefits on clinical practice of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) are predominantly determined by the quality of the clinical rules used in this system. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the performance and potential benefits on quality of care of these rules.METHODS: A clinical rule assisting physicians in selecting the appropriate dosage according to renal function of frequently prescribed antimicrobials was developed. In 2004, 1788 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 12 h were included in this retrospective study. The actual number of dosage adjustments without the support of the CDSS was compared with the theoretical number of dosage adjustments determined by the clinical rule in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance (Cl(creat)) 10-50 ml/min) and severe (Cl(creat) <10 ml/min) renal dysfunction. If dosage adjustment was omitted, the duration of excessive anti-infective dosing and extra drug costs involved was determined.RESULTS: Dosage adjustment of antimicrobials was omitted in 163 patients (86%) with moderate renal failure and 13 patients (54%) with severe renal failure. Excessive exposure was most frequently detected in patients receiving fluconazole and ciprofloxacin (median duration of 6 days). In our ICU alone, more than 16,000 euro ($19 000) can be saved annually by adjusting the dosage according to renal function of frequently prescribed antimicrobials.CONCLUSIONS: Despite intensive monitoring of patients in the ICU, dosage adjustment of antimicrobials is often omitted.

Frequent haemoglobin monitoring may allow earlier detection of trends in haemoglobin slopes, alerting staff to intercurrent events. The more frequent haemoglobin values may provide early evidence of response to erythropoietin (EPO) doses, and allow more appropriate anaemia management.

The mean number of missed pills per cycle did not differ significantly between the groups: 4.9+/-3.0 for the text-message group and 4.6+/-3.5 for the control group (P=.60). The number of missed pills per cycle increased over the course of the study, but this pattern did not increase differentially between the groups. Adherence recorded by the electronic monitoring device indicated much poorer adherence than that recorded by patient diaries. Despite poor pill-taking, there were no pregnancies.CONCLUSION: Daily text-message reminders did not improve oral contraceptive pill adherence.

To address this communication gap in the e-prescribing process, we implemented a system called Show Your Work (SYW) that appends alerts and override comments to e-prescriptions generated by an e-prescribing system. To assess the quantitative impact of this system, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study to assess pharmacy callback rates and types, and to uncover any unintended consequences of the annotations. Each day, SYW output across the enterprise was turned ""on"" or ""off"" randomly for all e-prescriptions. A convenience sample of three pharmacies, blinded to SYW status, submitted callback logs each day. These logs were used to calculate the rate of and reason for callbacks. At the conclusion of the study, we surveyed the 50 most frequently used pharmacies in our area to assess the impact of SYW on satisfaction and communication. A total of 202 callbacks had occurred yielding a callback rate of 45 callbacks/1000 prescriptions for SYW ""on"" days and 40 callbacks/1000 prescriptions for ""off"" days (p=0.4). We received 38 surveys (76% response rate) with 33 respondents commenting about SYW. Most respondents agreed (69%) that SYW favorably impacted callbacks--especially with pediatric prescriptions (82%). Comments suggested that SYW increased callbacks where necessary and decreased them in other situations, but did not contribute to unnecessary callbacks.

M.","AIMS: To evaluate the changes over time in quality and quantity of coping skills acquired following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and examine potential mediating effects on substance use outcomes.DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of a computerized version of CBT (CBT4CBT) as an adjunct to standard out-patient treatment over an 8-week period.SETTING: Data were collected from individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence in an out-patient community setting.PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two substance abusing individuals (50% African American), with an average age of 42 years, and a majority reporting cocaine as their primary drug of choice.MEASUREMENTS: Participants' responses to behavioral role-plays of situations associated with high risk for drug and alcohol use were audio-taped and rated independently to assess their coping responses.FINDINGS: There were statistically significant increases in mean ratings of the quality of participants' coping responses for those assigned to CBT4CBT compared to treatment as usual, and these differences remained significant 3 months after treatment completion. Moreover, quality of coping responses mediated the effect of treatment on participants' duration of abstinence during the follow-up period.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that assignment to the computerized CBT program improved participants' coping skills, as measured by independent ratings of a role-playing task. It is also the first study to test and support quality of coping skills acquired as a mediator of the effect of CBT for substance use.Copyright © 2010 The Authors, Addiction © 2010 Society for the Study of Addiction.",2010,Dec,Addiction,105,12,2120-7,20854334,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03076.x,"",Kiluk 2010,Exclusion reason: Did not evaluate CCDSS; 
Automated reminders increase adherence to guidelines for administration of prophylaxis for postoperative nausea and vomiting,"Kooij, F. O.; Klok, T.; Hollmann, M. W.; Kal, J. E.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Correct identification of patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), prescription of PONV prophylaxis and correct administration of medication are all important for effective PONV prophylaxis. This has been acknowledged by development of guidelines throughout the world. We studied the effect of introducing patient-specific automated reminders on timely administration of PONV prophylaxis medication during general anaesthesia.METHODS: During the visit to the preoperative screening clinic, patients at high risk for PONV were identified and PONV prophylaxis was prescribed. To study the effect of patient-specific decision support [a pop-up window reminding the (nurse) anaesthetist that PONV prophylaxis had been prescribed for this particular patient] on the timely administration of PONV medication, we queried our database to extract data on all patients for three consecutive periods: 6 weeks before decision support (control), 12 weeks during decision support and 6 weeks after discontinuation of decision support (postdecision support) and studied how often PONV prophylaxis was administered correctly.RESULTS: Between November 2005 and May 2006, 1727, 2594 and 1331 patients presented for elective surgery in the control, decision support and postdecision support periods, respectively. In the control period, 236 patients receiving general anaesthesia were scheduled to receive PONV prophylaxis. Of these, 93 (39%) received both dexamethasone and granisetron in the correct timeframe. This increased to 464 (79%) out of 591 patients in the decision support period and decreased back to 99 (41%) out of 243 patients in the postdecision support period (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Decision support is effective in improving administration and timing of PONV prophylaxis medication.

How to translate therapeutic recommendations in clinical practice guidelines into rules for critiquing physician prescriptions? Methods and application to five guidelines,"Lamy, J. B.; Ebrahiminia, V.; Riou, C.; Seroussi, B.; Bouaud, J.; Simon, C.; Dubois, S.; Butti, A.; Simon, G.; Favre, M.; Falcoff, H.; Venot, A.","BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines give recommendations about what to do in various medical situations, including therapeutical recommendations for drug prescription. An effective way to computerize these recommendations is to design critiquing decision support systems, i.e. systems that criticize the physician's prescription when it does not conform to the guidelines. These systems are commonly based on a list of ""if conditions then criticism"" rules. However, writing these rules from the guidelines is not a trivial task. The objective of this article is to propose methods that (1) simplify the implementation of guidelines' therapeutical recommendations in critiquing systems by automatically translating structured therapeutical recommendations into a list of ""if conditions then criticize"" rules, and (2) can generate an appropriate textual label to explain to the physician why his/her prescription is not recommended.METHODS: We worked on the therapeutic recommendations in five clinical practice guidelines concerning chronic diseases related to the management of cardiovascular risk. We evaluated the system using a test base of more than 2000 cases.RESULTS: Algorithms for automatically translating therapeutical recommendations into ""if conditions then criticize"" rules are presented. Eight generic recommendations are also proposed; they are guideline-independent, and can be used as default behaviour for handling various situations that are usually implicit in the guidelines, such as decreasing the dose of a poorly tolerated drug. Finally, we provide models and methods for generating a human-readable textual critique. The system was successfully evaluated on the test base.CONCLUSION: We show that it is possible to criticize physicians' prescriptions starting from a structured clinical guideline, and to provide clear explanations.

B.; Olsha-Yehiav, M.; Middleton, B.","OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Quality Dashboard, an electronic health record (EHR)-based feedback system, changed antibiotic prescribing.STUDY DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled trial.METHODS: We randomly assigned 27 primary care practices to receive the ARI Quality Dashboard or usual care. The primary outcome was the intent-to-intervene antibiotic prescribing rate for ARI visits. We also compared antibiotic prescribing between ARI Quality Dashboard users and nonusers.RESULTS: During the 9-month intervention, there was no difference between intervention and control practices in antibiotic prescribing for all ARI visits (47% vs 47%; P = .87), antibiotic-appropriate ARI visits (65% vs 64%; P = .68), or non-antibiotic-appropriate ARI visits (38% vs 40%; P = .70). Among the 258 intervention clinicians, 72 (28%) used the ARI Quality Dashboard at least once. These clinicians had a lower overall ARI antibiotic prescribing rate (42% vs 50% for nonusers; P = .02). This difference was due to less antibiotic prescribing for non-antibiotic-appropriate ARIs (32% vs 43%; P = .004), including nonstreptococcal pharyngitis (31% vs 41%; P = .01) and nonspecific upper respiratory infections (19% vs 34%; P = .01).CONCLUSIONS: The ARI Quality Dashboard was not associated with an overall change in antibiotic prescribing for ARIs, although when used, it was associated with improved antibiotic prescribing.

Improvement of hypertension management by structured physician education and feedback system: cluster randomized trial,"Luders, S.; Schrader, J.; Schmieder, R. E.; Smolka, W.; Wegscheider, K.; Bestehorn, K.","INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess whether hypertension management with a structured physician information program and a feedback system leads to improved blood pressure (BP) control and cardiovascular outcomes.METHODS: Cluster randomized (3 : 1), open, monitored, multicenter trial in Germany. Primary care-based physicians in the information group (IG) received detailed training on hypertension guidelines, feedback on target-level attainment, and a reminder to intensify treatment after each patient visit, whereas the observation/control group (CG) did not receive any such measures. A three-level mixed model was developed. Time-independent level differences between groups, group-independent changes, and nonparallel group-specific changes over time were tested.RESULTS: A total of 15 041 (78.1%) hypertensive patients were in the IG and 4213 (21.9%) in the CG. By 1-year follow-up, 82.9% of patients in the IG and 81.5% in the CG remained in the study. The guideline-oriented BP target was attained by 56.8% in the IG and 52.5% in the CG (+4.3%, P = 0.03), whereas the individual BP target was attained by 57.0% in the IG and 51% in the CG (P = NS). BP control in the IG was achieved 2 months earlier on average. Clinical inertia, defined as the absence of medication changes, despite noncontrol of BP, occurred significantly less often in the IG group. One-year cardiovascular outcomes did not differ between groups.CONCLUSION: The delivery of systematic information in connection with a feedback system reduces clinical inertia and improves guideline adherence.

Interventions to improve suboptimal prescribing in nursing homes: A narrative review,"Marcum, Z. A.; Handler, S. M.; Wright, R.; Hanlon, J. T.","BACKGROUND: Appropriate medication prescribing for nursing home residents remains a challenge.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to conduct a narrative review of the published literature describing randomized controlled trials that used interventions to improve suboptimal prescribing in nursing homes.METHODS: The PubMed, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published in the English language between January 1975 and December 2009, using the terms drug utilization, pharmaceutical services, aged, long-term care, nursing homes, prescribing, geriatrics, and randomized controlled trial. A manual search of the reference lists of identified articles and the authors' files, book chapters, and recent review articles was also conducted. Abstracts and posters from meetings were not included in the search. Studies were included if they: (1) had a randomized controlled design; (2) had a process measure outcome for quality of prescribing or a distal outcome measure for medication-related adverse patient events; and (3) involved nursing home residents.RESULTS: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Seven of those studies described educational approaches using various interventions (eg, outreach visits) and measured suboptimal prescribing in different manners (eg, adherence to guidelines). Two studies described computerized decision-support systems to measure the intervention's impact on adverse drug events (ADEs) and appropriate drug orders. Five studies described clinical pharmacist activities, most commonly involving a medication review, and used various measures of suboptimal prescribing, including a measure of medication appropriateness and the total number of medications prescribed. Two studies each described multidisciplinary and multifaceted approaches that included heterogeneous interventions and measures of prescribing. Most (15/18; 83.3%) of these studies reported statistically significant improvements in >or=1 aspect of suboptimal prescribing. Only 3 of the studies reported significant improvements in distal health outcomes, and only 3 measured ADEs or adverse drug reactions.CONCLUSIONS: Mixed results were reported for a variety of approaches used to improve suboptimal prescribing. However, the heterogeneity of the study interventions and the various measures of suboptimal prescribing used in these studies does not allow for an authoritative conclusion based on the currently available literature.Copyright 2010 Excerpta Medica Inc.

ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings: Monitoring and patient education--2009,"Pedersen, C. A.; Schneider, P. J.; Scheckelhoff, D. J.","PURPOSE: Results of the 2009 ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings that pertain to monitoring and patient education are presented.METHODS: A stratified random sample of pharmacy directors at 1364 general and children's medical-surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed by mail. SDI Health supplied data on hospital characteristics; the survey sample was drawn from SDI's hospital database.RESULTS: The response rate was 40.5%. Virtually all hospitals (97.3%) had pharmacists regularly monitor medication therapy in some capacity; nearly half monitored 75% or more of their patients. Over 92% had pharmacists routinely monitor serum medication concentrations or their surrogate markers, and most hospitals allowed pharmacists to order initial serum concentrations (80.1%) and adjust dosages (79.2%). Interdisciplinary committees reviewed adverse drug events in 89.3% of hospitals. Prospective analysis was conducted by 66.2% of hospitals, and retrospective analysis was performed by 73.6%. An assessment of safety culture had been conducted by 62.8% of hospitals. Most hospitals assigned oversight for patient medication education to nursing (89.0%), but many hospitals (68.9%) reported that pharmacists provided medication education to 1-25% of patients. Computerized prescriber-order-entry systems with clinical decision support were in place in 15.4%, bar-code-assisted medication administration systems were used by 27.9%, smart infusion pumps were used in 56.2%, and complete electronic medical record systems were in place in 8.8% of hospitals. The majority of hospitals (64.7%) used an integrated pharmacy practice model using clinical generalists.CONCLUSION: Pharmacists were significantly involved in monitoring medication therapy. Pharmacists were less involved in medication education activities. Technologies to improve the use of medications were used in an increasing percentage of hospitals.

This study was aimed at identifying the nature, cause, and potential remedies for medication errors in otolaryngologic surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective and descriptive.METHODS: Clinicians were incentivized for reporting possible medication errors that occurred from the preoperative through the first postoperative clinic visit over a 2-month period. Each report was investigated by an expert panel to determine validity, preventability, contributing factors, and potential preventative measures. A random sample of procedures and clinic visits were monitored for compliance with safe medication practices and information flow.RESULTS: From 589 surgeries, 20 medication errors were reported (two preoperative, four operative, five during hospital admission, two in transition between services, four during discharge, and three postoperative). Errors included wrong dose (seven), omitted dose (six), wrong drug (five), wrong site (two), and unnecessary drug (one). Causes included failure to consider weight-based dosing, use accurate drug references, calculate the total medication supply needed, verify the administration site, consider pertinent patient information (e.g., allergies), reconcile medications upon transfers, and document medication histories. Use of preprinted order forms was flawed, and discharge instructions were insufficient to guide patients postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: Failure to adhere to safe medication-use practices occurred throughout perioperative care.

Clinical decision support implemented with academic detailing improves prescribing of key renally cleared drugs in the hospital setting,"Roberts, G. W.; Farmer, C. J.; Cheney, P. C.; Govis, S. M.; Belcher, T. W.; Walsh, S. A.; Adams, R. J.","OBJECTIVE: Lack of dose adjustment for renally cleared drugs in the presence of poor renal function is a common problem in the hospital setting. The absence of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) from direct clinician workflows such as computerized provider order entry (CPOE) hinders the uptake of CDSS. This study implemented CDSS in an environment independent of CPOE, introduced to prescribers via academic detailing, to address the dosing of renally cleared drugs.DESIGN: GFR+ was designed to automatically calculate and update renal function, doses of key drugs adjusted for renal function, and highlight clinically significant decreases in renal function. Prescribers were made aware of GFR+, its navigation, and surrounding clinical issues, using academic detailing.MEASUREMENT: The rate of dosing conformity and management for key renally cleared drugs in hospitalized patients, before and after GFR+ implementation.RESULTS: Improvements were seen in dosing conformity for enoxaparin (from 68% to 86%, p=0.03), gentamicin (63-87%, p=0.01), and vancomycin (47-77%, p=0.07), as well as the appropriate use of gentamicin therapeutic drug monitoring (70-90%, p=0.02).

Effect of reminders of personal sacrifice and suggested rationalizations on residents' self-reported willingness to accept gifts: a randomized trial,"Sah, S.; Loewenstein, G.","CONTEXT: Despite expanding research on the prevalence and consequences of conflicts of interest in medicine, little attention has been given to the psychological processes that enable physicians to rationalize the acceptance of gifts.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether reminding resident physicians of the sacrifices made to obtain training, as well as suggesting this as a potential rationalization, increases self-stated willingness to accept gifts from industry.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred one US resident physicians from 2 sample populations (pediatrics and family medicine) who were recruited during March-July 2009 participated in a survey presented as evaluating quality of life and values.INTERVENTION: Physicians were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 different online surveys. The sacrifice reminders survey (n = 120) asked questions about sacrifices made in medical training, followed by questions regarding the acceptability of receiving gifts from industry. The suggested rationalization survey (n = 121) presented the same sacrifice questions, followed by a suggested possible rationalization (based on sacrifices made in medical training) for acceptance of gifts, before the questions regarding the acceptability of gifts. The control survey (n = 60) asked about the acceptability of gifts before asking questions about sacrifices or suggesting a rationalization.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician self-stated acceptability of receiving gifts from industry.RESULTS: Reminding physicians of sacrifices made in obtaining their education resulted in gifts being evaluated as more acceptable: 21.7% (13/60) in the control group vs 47.5% (57/120) in the sacrifice reminders group (odds ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.58; P = .001).

To assess background secular trends, e-prescribing was compared with a concurrent random sample of hand-generated prescriptions.MEASUREMENTS: Proportion of generic medications prescribed before and after the intervention, evaluated over time, and compared with a sample of prescriptions generated without e-prescribing.RESULTS: The proportion of generic medication prescriptions increased from 32.1% to 54.2% after the intervention (22.1% increase, 95% CI 21.9% to 22.3%), with no diminution in magnitude of improvement post-intervention. In the concurrent control group, increases in proportion of generic prescriptions (29.3% to 31.4% to 37.4% in the pre-intervention, post-intervention, and end-of-study periods, respectively) were not commensurate with the intervention.

L.; Schinnar, R.; Aberra, F.; Bilker, W.; Hennessy, S.; Leonard, C. E.; Pifer, E.","BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems has been modest, largely because clinicians frequently override electronic alerts.METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nearly ""hard stop"" CPOE prescribing alert intended to reduce concomitant orders for warfarin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a randomized clinical trial was conducted at 2 academic medical centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1981 clinicians were assigned to either an intervention group receiving a nearly hard stop alert or a control group receiving the standard practice. The study duration was August 9, 2006, through February 13, 2007.RESULTS: The proportion of desired responses (ie, not reordering the alert-triggering drug within 10 minutes of firing) was 57.2% (111 of 194 hard stop alerts) in the intervention group and 13.5% (20 of 148) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.045-0.33).

Treatment side effects, cost, and complexity are common reasons for nonadherence, and physicians are often unaware of these potentially modifiable problems.OBJECTIVE: To determine if a cardiovascular medication tracking and nonadherence alert system, incorporated into a computerized health record system, would increase drug profile review by primary care physicians, increase the likelihood of therapy change, and improve adherence with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs.METHODS: There were 2293 primary care patients prescribed lipid-lowering or antihypertensive drugs who were randomized to the adherence tracking and alert system or active medication list alone to determine if the intervention increased drug profile review, changes in cardiovascular drug treatment, and refill adherence in the first 6 months. An intention to treat analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within physician.RESULTS: Overall, medication adherence was below 80% for 36.3% of patients using lipid-lowering drugs and 40.8% of patients using antihypertensives at the start of the trial. There was a significant increase in drug profile review in the intervention compared to the control group (44.5% v. 35.5%; P < 0.001), a nonsignificant increase in drug discontinuations due to side effects (2.3% v. 2.0%; P = 0.61), and a reduction in therapy increases (28.5% v. 29.1%; P = 0.86). There was no significant change in refill adherence after 6 months of follow-up.CONCLUSION: An adherence tracking and alert system increases drug review but not therapy changes or adherence in prevalent users of cardiovascular drug treatment.

"Computerized decision support for medication dosing in renal insufficiency: a randomized, controlled trial","Terrell, K. M.; Perkins, A. J.; Hui, S. L.; Callahan, C. M.; Dexter, P. R.; Miller, D. K.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: Emergency physicians prescribe several discharge medications that require dosage adjustment for patients with renal disease. The hypothesis for this research was that decision support in a computerized physician order entry system would reduce the rate of excessive medication dosing for patients with renal impairment.METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled trial in an academic emergency department (ED), in which computerized physician order entry was used to write all prescriptions for patients being discharged from the ED. The sample included 42 physicians who were randomized to the intervention (21 physicians) or control (21 physicians) group. The intervention was decision support that provided dosing recommendations for targeted medications for patients aged 18 years and older when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance level was below the threshold for dosage adjustment. The primary outcome was the proportion of targeted medications that were excessively dosed.RESULTS: For 2,783 (46%) of the 6,015 patient visits, the decision support had sufficient information to estimate the patient's creatinine clearance level. The average age of these patients was 46 years, 1,768 (64%) were women, and 1,523 (55%) were black. Decision support was provided 73 times to physicians in the intervention group, who excessively dosed 31 (43%) prescriptions. In comparison, control physicians excessively dosed a significantly larger proportion of medications: 34 of 46, 74% (effect size=31%; 95% confidence interval 14% to 49%; P=.001).CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians often prescribed excessive doses of medications that require dosage adjustment for renal impairment.

Modeling and optimization of combined cytostatic and cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy,"Villasana, M.; Ochoa, G.; Aguilar, S.","OBJECTIVES: This study extends a previous mathematical model of cancer cytotoxic chemotherapy, which considered cycling tumor cells and interactions with the immune system, by incorporating a different type of drug: a cytostatic agent. The effect of a cytostatic drug is to arrest cells in a phase of their cycle. In consequence, once tumor cells are arrested and synchronized they can be targeted with a cytotoxic agent, thus maximizing cell kill fraction and minimizing normal cell killing. The goal is to incorporate the new drug into the chemotherapy protocol and devise optimal delivery schedules.METHODS: The problem of designing efficient combined chemotherapies is formulated as an optimal control problem and tackled using a state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm for real-valued encoding, namely the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Alternative solution representations and three formulations of the underlying objective function are proposed and compared.RESULTS: The optimization problem was successfully solved by the proposed approach. The encoding that enforced non-overlapping (simultaneous) application of the two types of drugs produced competitive protocols with significant less amount of toxic drug, thus achieving better immune system health. When compared to treatment protocols that only consider a cytotoxic agent, the incorporation of a cytostatic drug dramatically improved the outcome and performance of the overall treatment, confirming in silico that the combination of a cytostatic with a cytotoxic agent improves the efficacy and efficiency of the chemotherapy.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the proposed approach can serve as a valuable decision support tool for the medical practitioner facing the complex problem of designing efficient combined chemotherapies.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A cluster-randomized trial to provide clinicians inhaled corticosteroid adherence information for their patients with asthma,"Williams, L. K.; Peterson, E. L.; Wells, K.; Campbell, J.; Wang, M.; Chowdhry, V. K.; Walsh, M.; Enberg, R.; Lanfear, D. E.; Pladevall, M.","BACKGROUND: Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) nonadherence is common among patients with asthma; however, interventions to improve adherence have often been complex and not easily applied to large patient populations.OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of supplying patient adherence information to primary care providers.METHODS: Patients and providers were members of a health system serving southeast Michigan. Providers (88 intervention; 105 control) and patients (1335 intervention; 1363 control) were randomized together by practice. Patients were age 5 to 56 years, had a diagnosis of asthma, and had existing prescriptions for ICS medication. Adherence was estimated by using prescription and fill data. Unlike clinicians in the control arm, intervention arm providers could view updated ICS adherence information on their patients via electronic prescription software, and further details on patient ICS use could be viewed by selecting that option. The primary outcome was ICS adherence in last 3 months of the study period.RESULTS: At the study end for the intention-to-treat analysis, ICS adherence was not different among patients in the intervention arm compared with those in the control arm (21.3% vs 23.3%, respectively; P = .553). However, adherence was significantly higher among patients whose clinician elected to view their detailed adherence information (35.7%) compared with both control arm patients (P = .026) and intervention arm patients whose provider did not view adherence data (P = .002).CONCLUSIONS: Overall, providing adherence information to clinicians did not improve ICS use among patients with asthma. However, patient use may improve when clinicians are sufficiently interested in adherence to view the details of this medication use.Copyright 2010 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Improvement of intraoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in prolonged cardiac surgery by automated alerts in the operating room,"Zanetti, G.; Flanagan, H. L.; Cohn, L. H.; Giardina, R.; Platt, R.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an automated intra-operative alert to redose prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged cardiac operations. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded trial. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery that lasted more than 4 hours after the preoperative administration of cefazolin, unless they were receiving therapeutic antibiotics at the time of surgery. INTERVENTION: Randomization to an audible and visual reminder on the operating room computer console at 225 minutes after the administration of preoperative antibiotics (reminder group, n = 137) or control (n = 136). After another 30 minutes, the circulating nurse was required to indicate whether a follow-up dose of antibiotics had been administered. RESULTS: Intraoperative redosing was significantly more frequent in the reminder group (93 of 137; 68916) than in the control group (55 of 136; 40916) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.97 to 5.56; P < .0001). The impact of the reminder was even greater when compared with the 6 months preceding the study period (129 of 480; 27%; P < .001), suggesting some spillover effect on the control group. Redosing was formally declined for 19 of the 44 patients in the reminder group without redosing. The rate of surgical-site infection in the reminder group (5 of 137; 4%) was similar to that in the control group (8 of 136; 6%; P = .42), but significantly lower than that in the pre-study period (48 of 480; 10%; P = .02).

Increasing smoking cessation care in a preoperative clinic: a randomized controlled trial,"Wolfenden, L.; Wiggers, J.; Knight, J.; Campbell, E.; Spigelman, A.; Kerridge, R.; Moore, K.","Background. Evidence suggests that preoperative clinics, like other hospital outpatient clinics and inpatient wards, fail to systematically provide smoking cessation care to patients having planned surgery. Methods. The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, acceptability, and cost of a multifaceted intervention to facilitate the provision of comprehensive smoking cessation care to patients attending a preoperative clinic. Two hundred ten smoking patients attending a preoperative clinic at a major teaching hospital in Australia took part in the study. One hundred twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group and 86 patients to a usual cessation care group. A multifaceted intervention was developed that included the use of opinion leaders, consensus processes, computer-delivered cessation care, computer-generated prompts for care provision by clinic staff, staff training, and performance feedback. Results. Ninety-six percent of experimental group patients received behavioral counseling and tailored self-help material. Experimental group patients were significantly more likely than usual care patients to report receiving brief advice by nursing (79% vs. 47%; P < 0.01) and anaesthetic (60% vs. 39%; P < 0.01) staff. Experimental group patients who were nicotine dependent were also more likely to be offered preoperative nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (82% vs. 8%; P < 0.01) and be prescribed postoperative NRT (86% vs. 0%; P < 0.01). The multifaceted intervention was found to be acceptable by staff. Conclusion. A multifaceted clinical practice change intervention may be effective in improving the delivery of smoking cessation care to preoperative surgical patients. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

"Cluster-randomized, controlled trial of computer-based decision support for selecting long-term anti-thrombotic therapy after acute ischaemic stroke","Weir, C. J.; Lees, K. R.; MacWalter, R. S.; Muir, K. W.; Wallesch, C. W.; McLelland, E. V.; Hendry, A.","BACKGROUND: Identifying the appropriate long-term anti-thrombotic therapy following acute ischaemic stroke is a challenging area in which computer-based decision support may provide assistance. AIM: To evaluate the influence on prescribing practice of a computer-based decision support system (CDSS) that provided patient-specific estimates of the expected ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular event rates under each potential anti-thrombotic therapy. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We recruited patients who presented for a first investigation of ischaemic stroke or TIA symptoms, excluding those with a poor prognosis or major contraindication to anticoagulation. After observation of routine prescribing practice (6 months) in each hospital, centres were randomized for 6 months to either control (routine practice observed) or intervention (practice observed while the CDSS provided patient-specific information). We compared, between control and intervention centres, the risk reduction (estimated by the CDSS) in ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular events achieved by long-term anti-thrombotic therapy, and the proportions of subjects prescribed the optimal therapy identified by the CDSS. RESULTS: Sixteen hospitals recruited 1952 subjects. When the CDSS provided information, the mean relative risk reduction attained by prescribing increased by 2.7 percentage units (95%CI -0.3 to 5.7) and the odds ratio for the optimal therapy being prescribed was 1.32 (0.83 to 1.80). Some 55% (5/9) of clinicians believed the CDSS had influenced their prescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Cluster-randomized trials provide excellent frameworks for evaluating novel clinical management methods. Our CDSS was feasible to implement and acceptable to clinicians, but did not substantially influence prescribing practice for anti-thrombotic drugs after acute ischaemic stroke.",2003,2003-Feb,QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians,96,2,143-53,MEDLINE:12589012,"","",Weir 2003,Exclusion reason: Not multi-faceted; 
"Use of the electrocardiograph-based thrombolytic predictive instrument to assist thrombolytic and reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction - A multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical effectiveness trial","Selker, H. P.; Beshansky, J. R.; Griffith, J. L.","Background: Deciding which patients should receive thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can be difficult, especially for less-obvious candidates and when consulting physicians are off site. Objective: To test whether the electrocardiograph-based Thrombolytic Predictive Instrument (TPI) improves use of thrombolytic and overall reperfusion therapy. Design: 22-month randomized, controlled, clinical effectiveness trial. Setting: Emergency departments at 28 urban, suburban, and rural hospitals in the United States. Patients: Persons presenting to the emergency department with AMI and ST-segment elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Intervention: TPI predictions automatically printed on ECG text headers. Measurements: Percentages of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour of initial ECG, and overall reperfusion (thrombolytic therapy or PTCA). Results: Of 2875 patients with AMI, 1243 (43.2%) had ST-segment elevation. Of these, 1197 were randomly assigned to study groups; 732 (61.2%) had inferior AMI, and 465 (38.8%) had anterior AMI. A total of 60.5% of controls and 62.1% of TPI patients (P = 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy, 52.5% of controls and 53.3% of TPI patients received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour (P > 0.2), and 67.6% of controls and 70.3% of TPI patients received overall reperfusion (P = 0.2). Of patients with inferior AMI in the control group versus the TPI group, 61.1% versus 67.6% (P = 0.03) received thrombolytic therapy, 53.2% versus 58.6% (P = 0.08) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 67.7% versus 74.7% (P = 0.03) received overall reperfusion. Of patients with anterior AMI in the control group versus the TPI group, 59.5% versus 53.9% (P > 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy, 51.4% versus 45.3% (P > 0.2) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 67.6% versus 63.8% (P > 0.2) received overall reperfusion. Among women (n = 398) in the control group versus the TPI group, 48.1% versus 58.2% (P = 0.03) received thrombolytic therapy, 40.5% versus 48.4% (P = 0.10) received thrombolytic therapy within I hour, and 55.7% versus 65.7% (P = 0.04) received overall reperfusion. Of patients who required physician consultation by telephone (n = 271) in the control group versus the TPI group, 47.3% versus 63.2% (P= 0.01) received thrombolytic therapy, 41.1 % versus 53.6% (P = 0.04) received thrombolytic therapy within 1 hour, and 50.7% versus 66.4% (P = 0.01) received overall reperfusion.

L.; Miller, C.; Magid, D. J.","Background: The importance of laboratory monitoring for drugs is reflected in product labeling and published guidelines, but monitoring recommendations are followed inconsistently. Opportunity exists to improve monitoring, with the potential to decrease therapy complications. Methods: The objective of this randomized trial was to determine whether computerized alerts were effective at increasing the percentage of ambulatory patients with laboratory monitoring at initiation of drug therapy. Physicians and pharmacists teamed up to develop organization-specific guidelines for monitoring selected drugs. In collaboration with physicians, pharmacists were alerted to missing laboratory test results, ordered missing tests, reminded patients to obtain tests, assessed test completion, reviewed test results, and managed abnormal results.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect on drug-prescribing behaviour of implementing prescribing guidelines by means of a reactive computer reminder system (CRS). Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial with an incomplete block design in the south of the Netherlands: 25 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about antibiotics and asthma/COPD prescriptions, 28 GPs (7 GP practices) received reminders about cholesterol prescriptions. Prescription guidelines were integrated into the computerised GP information system. Measurements: Both performance indicators and prescription volumes were calculated as the main outcome measures. Next to individual volume measure, sum scores were constructed on the volume measures per drug group (antibiotics, asthma/COPD and cholesterol). Results: Variation between GPs turned out to be larger and more skewed than expected. No differences between groups were found for indicators and volumes related to recommendations advocating certain drugs. Although there was a tendency towards clinically relevant results for prescription volumes that were supposed to drop, the difference in sum score between the groups was not significant. For antibiotic prescriptions that were supposed to drop, the sum score for the intervention group was 28.2 (95% CI: 20.8-44.5) prescriptions per 1000 patients per GP, while this was 39.7 (95% CI: 29.7-64.1) for the control group (p 0.2).

On three specific recommendations (on quinolones for cystitis, corticosteroids for CPOD, and antibiotics for acute sore throat) significant differences were found.

Impact of Non-interruptive Medication Laboratory Monitoring Alerts in Ambulatory Care,"Lo, Helen G.; Matheny, Michael E.; Seger, Diane L.; Bates, David W.; Gandhi, Tejal K.","Objective: Interruptive alerts within electronic applications can cause ""alert fatigue"" if they fire too frequently or are clinically reasonable only some of the time. We assessed the impact of non-interruptive, real-time medication laboratory alerts on provider lab test ordering. Design: We enrolled 22 Outpatient practices into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Clinics either used the existing system or received on-screen recommendations for baseline laboratory tests when prescribing new medications. Since the warnings were non-interruptive, providers did not have to act upon or acknowledge the notification to complete a medication request. Measurements: Data were collected each time providers performed suggested laboratory testing within 14 days of a new prescription order. Findings were adjusted for patient and provider characteristics as well as patient clustering within clinics. Results: Among 12 clinics with 191 providers in the control group and 10 clinics with 175 providers in the intervention group, there were 3673 total events where baseline lab tests would have been advised: 1988 events in the control group and 1685 in the intervention group. In the control group, baseline labs were requested for 771 (39%) of the medications. In the intervention group, baseline labs were ordered by clinicians in 689 (41%) of the cases.

A randomized clinical trial of clinician feedback to improve quality of care for inner-city children with asthma,"Kattan, M.; Crain, E. F.; Steinbach, S.; Visness, C. M.; Walter, M.; Stout, J. W.; Evans, R.; Smartt, E.; Gruchalla, R. S.; Morgan, W. J.; O'Connor, G. T.; Mitchell, H. E.","CONTEXT. Barriers impede translating recommendations for asthma treatment into practice, particularly in inner cities where asthma morbidity is highest. METHODS. The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of timely patient feedback in the form of a letter providing recent patient-specific symptoms, medication, and health service use combined with guideline-based recommendations for changes in therapy on improving the quality of asthma care by inner-city primary care providers and on resultant asthma morbidity. This was a randomized, controlled clinical trial in 5- to 11-year-old children (n = 937) with moderate to severe asthma receiving health care in hospital- and community-based clinics and private practices in 7 inner-city urban areas. The caretaker of each child received a bimonthly telephone call to collect clinical information about the child's asthma. For a full year, the providers of intervention group children received bimonthly computer-generated letters based on these calls summarizing the child's asthma symptoms, health service use, and medication use with a corresponding recommendation to step up or step down medications. We measured the number and proportion of scheduled visits resulting in stepping up of medications, asthma symptoms (2-week recall), and health care use (2-month recall). RESULTS. In this population, only a modest proportion of children whose symptoms warranted a medication increase actually had a scheduled visit to reevaluate their asthma treatment. However, in the 2-month interval after receipt of a step-up letter, 17.1% of the letters were followed by scheduled visits in the intervention group compared with scheduled visits 12.3% of the time by the control children with comparable clinical symptoms. Asthma medications were stepped up when indicated after 46.0% of these visits in the intervention group compared with 35.6% in the control group, and when asthma symptoms warranted a step up in therapy, medication changes occurred earlier among the intervention children. Among children whose medications were stepped up at any time during the 12-month study period, those in the intervention group experienced 22.1% fewer symptom days and 37.9% fewer school days missed. The intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference over the intervention year in the number of symptom days, yet there was a trend toward fewer days of limited activity and a significant decrease in emergency department visits by the intervention group compared with controls. This 24% drop in emergency department visits resulted in an intervention that was cost saving in its first year. CONCLUSIONS. Patient-specific feedback to inner-city providers increased scheduled asthma visits, increased asthma visits in which medications were stepped up when clinically indicated, and reduced emergency department visits.",2006,Jun,Pediatrics,117,6,E1095-E1103,WOS:000237979000087,10.1542/peds.2005-2160,"",Kattan 2006,Exclusion reason: Not multi-faceted; 
Prescribers' responses to alerts during medication ordering in the long term care setting,"Judge, James; Field, Terry S.; DeFlorio, Martin; Laprino, Jane; Auger, Jill; Rochon, Paula; Bates, David W.; Gurwitz, Jerry H.","Objective: Computerized physician order entry with clinical decision support has been shown to improve medication safety in adult inpatients, but few data are available regarding its usefulness in the long-term care setting. The objective of this study was to examine opportunities for improving medication safety in that clinical setting by determining the proportion of medication orders that would generate a warning message to the prescriber via a computerized clinical decision support system and assessing the extent to which these alerts would affect prescribers' actions. Design: The study was set within a randomized controlled trial of computerized clinical decision support conducted in the long-stay units of a large, academically-affiliated long-term care facility. In March 2002, a computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) was added to an existing computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. Over a subsequent one-year study period, prescribers ordering drugs for residents on three resident-care units of the facility were presented with alerts; these alerts were not displayed to prescribers in the four control units. Measurements: We assessed the frequency of drug orders associated with various categories of alerts across all participating units of the facility. To assess the impact of actually receiving an alert on prescriber behavior during drug ordering, we calculated separately for the intervention and control units the proportion of the alerts, within each category, that were followed by an appropriate action and estimated the relative risk of an appropriate action m the intervention units compared to the control units. Results: During the 12 months of the study, there were 445 residents on the participating units of the facility, contributing 3,726 resident-months of observation time. During this period, 47,997 medication orders were entered through the CPOE system-approximately 9 medication orders per resident per month. 9,414 alerts were triggered (2.5 alerts per resident-month). The alert categories most often triggered were related to risks of central nervous system side-effects such as over-sedation (20%). Alerts for risk of drug-associated constipation (13%) or renal insufficiency/electrolyte imbalance (12%) were also common. Twelve percent of the alerts were related to orders for warfarin. Overall, prescribers who received alerts were only slightly more likely to take an appropriate action (relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.00, 1.22). Alerts related to orders for warfarin or central nervous system side effects were most likely to engender an appropriate action, such as ordering a recommended laboratory test or canceling an ordered drug. Conclusion: Long-term care facilities must implement new system-level approaches with the potential to improve medication safety for their residents. The number of medication orders that triggered a warning message in this study suggests that CPOE with a clinical decision support system may represent one such tool. However, the relatively low rate of response to these alerts suggests that further refinements to such systems are required, and that their impact on medication errors and adverse drug events must be carefully assessed.",2006,Jul-Aug,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,13,4,385-390,WOS:000239072800004,10.1197/jamia.M1945,"",Judge 2006,Exclusion reason: Not multi-faceted;

B.; Jacgues, J.; Juster, I.; Reisman, L.","Objective: To demonstrate the potential effect of deploying a sentinel system that scans administrative claims information and clinical data to detect and mitigate errors in care and deviations from best medical practices. Methods: Members (n = 39 462; age range, 12-64 years) of a midwestern managed care plan were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The sentinel system was programmed with more than 1000 decision rules that were capable of generating clinical recommendations. Clinical recommendations triggered for subjects in the intervention group were relayed to treating physicians, and those for the control group were deferred to study end. Results: Nine hundred eight clinical recommendations were issued to the intervention group. Among those in both groups who triggered recommendations, there were 19% fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group compared with the control group (P < .001). Charges among those whose recommendations were communicated were $77.91 per member per month (pmpm) lower and paid claims were $68.08 pmpm lower than among controls compared with the baseline values (P = .003 for both). Paid claims for the entire intervention group (with or without recommendations) were $8.07 pmpm lower than those for the entire control group. In contrast, the intervention cost $1.00 pmpm, suggesting an 8-fold return on investment.

Implementing clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertension in general practice,"Hetlevik, I.; Holmen, J.; Kruger, O.; Kristensen, P.; Iversen, H.","Discrepancies between clinical guidelines and clinical practice call for practical implementation strategies. This study evaluates the implementation of clinical guidelines for hypertension in general practice with a specific computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) as part of the intervention. We carried out a randomized study of general practice health centres in Sor- and Nord-Trondelag counties in Norway (population 380000). A total of 17 health centres were included, with 24 doctors and 984 patients in the intervention group. Data from 887 patients was used in the analyses. There were 12 health centres with 29 doctors and 1255 patients in the control group. Data from 1127 control patients was used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were doctor's behaviour, measured by adherence to registration of recommended variables in the Norwegian clinical guidelines for hypertension. The aim of the intervention was to lower the fractions of patients without registrations. However, there were no clinically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for fractions of patients without registration of blood pressure (intervention group 14.3%, control group 14.2%) or serum cholesterol (62.3% vs. 56.8%) during 12 months, nor, during 18 months, for fractions of patients without a registration of cigarette smoking (82.9% vs. 87.1%), cardiovascular inheritance (79.5% vs. 73.4%) and body mass index (81.5% vs. 89.2%). One or several variables necessary for calculation of risk score for myocardial infarction were missing in 91.7% of patients in the intervention group and 91.9% of patients in the control group. Large centre variations were shown for all variables. Implementation of clinical guidelines in the treatment of hypertensive patients in general practice, by means of a CDSS and several procedures for implementation did not result in clinically significant changes in the doctors' behaviour.

Process evaluation of a cluster randomized trial of tailored interventions to implement guidelines in primary care - why is it so hard to change practice?,"Flottorp, S.; Havelsrud, K.; Oxman, A. D.","Background. A cluster randomized trial of tailored interventions to support the implementation of guidelines for sore throat and urinary tract infection found little or no change in the main outcomes, which were antibiotic prescriptions, use of laboratory tests and use of telephone consultations. There was great variation between the practices in the change in these outcomes. Objectives. Our aim was to evaluate how the interventions were received and to understand why practices did or did not change. Methods. The trial was conducted in general practices in Norway. Data for this process evaluation were collected from the 120 practices that completed the trial. Multiple methods were used: observations, semi-structured telephone interviews, a postal survey and data extracted from electronic medical records. We investigated factors that might explain a lack of change, including: agreement with the guidelines; communication within each practice; degree of participation in the project; taking time to discuss the guidelines and their implementation; use of the components of the interventions; and routines for telephone consultations. Possible explanatory factors were explored in relation to variation in change and the overall extent of change in rates of use of antibiotics, laboratory tests and telephone consultations. Results. Sixty-three per cent of practices agreed with the guidelines. Only 35% reported having regular meetings, and 33% discussed the project before its start, although 75% reported agreement about participating within the practice. Only 33% reported meeting to discuss the guidelines. Use of the components of the interventions ranged from 11% for the increased fee for telephone consultations to 48% for the computerized decision support. Forty-four per cent reported problems with telephone routines. No single factor explained the observed variation in the extent of change across practices. Conclusions. Inadequate time, resources and support were the most salient factors that might explain a lack of change.

DESIGN Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING An academic emergency department (ED) in Indianapolis, Indiana, where computerized physican order entry was used to write all medication prescriptions. PARTICIPANTS Sixty-three emergency physicians were randomized to the intervention (32 physicians) or control (31 physicians) group. INTERVENTION Decision support that advised against use of nine potentially inappropriate medications and recommended safer substitute therapies. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was the proportion of ED visits by seniors that resulted in one or more prescriptions for an inappropriate medication. The main secondary outcomes were the proportions of medications prescribed that were inappropriate and intervention physicians' reasons for rejecting the decision support. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 74, two-thirds were female, and just over half were African American. Decision support was provided 114 times to intervention physicians, who accepted 49 (43%) of the recommendations. Intervention physicians prescribed one or more inappropriate medications during 2.6% of ED visits by seniors, compared with 3.9% of visits managed by control physicians (P=.02; odds ratio=0.55, 95% confidence interval=0.34-0.89). The proportion of all prescribed medications that were inappropriate significantly decreased from 5.4% to 3.4%. The most common reason for rejecting decision support was that the patient had no prior problems with the medication.

Design: Randomized trial within the long-stay units of a large long-term care facility. Randomization was within blocks by unit type. Alerts related to medication prescribing for residents with renal insufficiency were displayed to prescribers in the intervention units and hidden but tracked in control units. Measurement: The proportions of final drug orders that were appropriate were compared between intervention and control units within alert categories: (1) recommended medication doses; (2) recommended administration frequencies; (3) recommendations to avoid the drug; (4) warnings of missing information. Results: The rates of alerts were nearly equal in the intervention and control units: 2.5 per 1,000 resident days in the intervention units and 2.4 in the control units.

H.; Aickin, M.; Swain, M. C.","OBJECTIVES: Osteoporosis treatment rates after a fracture are low. This study evaluated methods to increase guideline-recommended osteoporosis care postfracture. DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to usual care or one of two interventions. Analysis of primary outcomes used electronic data and linear regression. SETTING: A Pacific Northwest nonprofit health maintenance organization. PARTICIPANTS: Female patients aged 50 to 89 who suffered a fracture in 1999 and had not received bone mineral density (BMD) measurement or medication for osteoporosis (n=311) and their primary care providers (n=159). INTERVENTION: Patient-specific clinical guideline advice to the primary care provider delivered by electronic medical record (EMR) message or electronic reminder to the provider plus an educational letter mailed to the patient. MEASUREMENTS: BMD measurement and osteoporosis medication. RESULTS: At 6 months, provider reminder resulted in 51.5% of patients receiving BMD measurement or osteoporosis medication, provider reminder plus patient education resulted in 43.1%, and usual care resulted in 5.9% (P <.001). The effect of provider advice combined with patient education was not significantly different from provider advice alone (P=.88).

Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients at risk for cardiovascular events who might benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were identified from electronic data in a managed care organization and randomly assigned into 2 groups. Physicians seeing outpatients in the intervention group were taxed a sheet with pertinent patient data, including a recommendation to prescribe the indicated medication.

Methods: In a two- year multicentre open label strategy trial, 299 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis were randomly assigned to the intensive strategy group or the conventional strategy group. Patients in both groups received MTX, the aim of treatment being remission. Patients in the intensive treatment group came to the outpatient clinic once every month; adjustment of the MTX dosage was tailored to the individual patient on the basis of predefined response criteria, using a computerised decision program. Patients of the conventional strategy group came to the outpatient clinic once every three months; they were treated according to common practice. Cyclosporine was added if patients had an inadequate response to maximal tolerated MTX doses. Results: Seventy six ( 50%) patients in the intensive strategy group achieved at least one period of remission during the two year trial, versus 55 patients ( 37%) in the conventional strategy group ( p = 0.03).

Our objective was to determine whether inappropriate prescribing could be reduced when primary care physicians had computer-based access to information on all prescriptions dispensed and automated alerts for potential prescribing problems. Methods: We randomly assigned 107 primary care physicians with at least 100 patients aged 66 years and older (total 12 560) to a group receiving computerized decision-making support (CD) or a control group. Physicians in the CIDS group had access to information on current and past prescriptions through a dedicated computer link to the provincial seniors' drug-insurance program. When any of 159 clinically relevant prescribing problems were identified by the CDS software, the physician received an alert that identified the nature of the problem, possible consequences, and alternative therapy. The rate of initiation and discontinuation of potentially inappropriate prescriptions was assessed over a 13-month period. Results: In the 2 months before the study, 31.8% of the patients in the CDS group and 33.3% of those in the control group had at least 1 potentially inappropriate prescription.

The objective was to evaluate the effect of the PWS on user satisfaction, on health-related outcomes, and on costs. Design: A one-year, two-period, randomized controlled trial with 37 subjects. Measurements: Differences in the reliance on noncomputer sources of information, in user satisfaction, in the cost of prescribed medications, and in the rate of clinically relevant drug interactions were assessed. Results: The study subjects logged onto the workstation an average of 6.53 times per provider and used it to generate 2.8% of prescriptions during the intervention period.

METHOD An electronic decision-support prompt identifying patients for a targeted proactive clinical intervention was developed and implemented. Each time an oral antidiabetic agent was dispensed, a prompt was displayed reminding pharmacists to discuss the suitability of aspirin therapy in eligible patients with diabetes. The prompt was randomly assigned to 31 of 52 metropolitan pharmacies in Melbourne (Australia) for 6 weeks, with the remaining pharmacies as controls. RESULTS One hundred and fifty pharmacists in 52 pharmacies recorded a total of 2396 clinical interventions at an intervention rate of 0.92 interventions per 100 patients [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58, 1.23]. Pharmacists recorded a total of 201 target interventions related to aspirin therapy in diabetes at an intervention rate of 2.55 interventions per 100 diabetic patients (95% CI 0.85, 4.24). All of the targeted clinical interventions were recorded in the prompt arm; no targeted interventions were recorded in the control group. The effect of the prompt decreased over the study period and was not maintained after prompt deactivation.

We built a computerized decision support system for antibiotic treatment (TREAT) targeting these outcomes. Methods: Prospective cohort study comparing TREAT's advice to physician's treatment followed by a cluster randomized trial comparing wards using TREAT (intervention) versus antibiotic monitoring without TREAT (control). We included patients suspected of harbouring bacterial infections in three hospitals (Israel, Germany and Italy). The primary outcome, appropriate antibiotic treatment, was assessed among patients with microbiologically documented infections (MDI). Length of hospital stay, adverse events, mortality (interventional trial) and antibiotic costs (both studies), including costs related to future antibiotic resistance, were compared among all included patients. Results: Among 1203 patients included in the cohort study (350 with MDI), TREAT prescribed appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment significantly more frequently than physicians (70% versus 57%, P < 0.001) using less broad-spectrum antibiotics at half physicians' antibiotic costs. The randomized trial included 2326 patients, 570 with MDI. The rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was higher in intervention versus control wards [73% versus 64%, odds ratio (OR): 1.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-2.29, intention to treat, adjusted for location and clustering]. For patients treated according to TREAT's advice in intervention wards, the difference with controls was highly significant (OR: 3.40, 95% CI: 2.25-5.14).

Evaluation of laboratory monitoring alerts within a computerized physician order entry system for medication orders,"Palen, Ted E.; Raebel, Marsha; Lyons, Ella; Magid, David M.","Background: Errors involving medication use are common. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) can improve prescribing practices. Few studies have examined the effect of CPOE in combination with decision support tools on prescribing practices in the outpatient setting. Less is known about prescribers' adherence to laboratory monitoring recommendations. Objective: To evaluate if reminders presented during CPOE for medications would increase physicians' compliance with guidelines for laboratory monitoring at initiation of therapy. Study Design: Randomized prospective intervention study. Methods: Two hundred seven primary care physicians in a group-model managed care organization were randomized to receive or not receive drug laboratory monitoring alerts within the CPOE system. Adherence to laboratory monitoring recommendations for patients prescribed selected medications was compared between physician groups. Results: There was no significant difference between the control and intervention group physicians in the overall rate of compliance with ordering the recommended laboratory monitoring for patients prescribed study medications. Laboratory monitoring was performed as recommended 56.6% of the time in the intervention group compared with 57.1% of the time in the control group (P = .31). In cases in which a statistically significant difference was demonstrated, improved compliance favored the intervention group (eg, 7, 1.2% vs 62.3% [P = .003] for gernfibrozil and 75.7% vs 73.9% IP = .051 for statins). Conclusions: As CPOE becomes more prevalent, additional research is needed to determine effective decision support tools.

J.","Background: Hospitalizations are an opportunity to provide preventive care. Objective: To determine if computer reminders, which we have shown to be effective in our ambulatory care setting, increase the provision of inpatient preventive care. Methods: Randomized, controlled trial on the general medicine inpatient service of an urban, university-affiliated public hospital. Study subjects were 78 house staff rotating on the 6 general medicine services. The intervention was reminders to physicians printed on daily rounds reports about preventive care for which their patients were eligible, and suggested orders for preventive care provided through the physicians' workstations. The preventive care guidelines were derived from the US Preventive Care Task Force recommendations. Compliance with preventive care guidelines and house staff attitudes toward providing preventive care to hospitalized patients were the main outcome measures. Results: No significant differences were seen between intervention and control physicians in compliance with preventive care guidelines in the aggregate or when individual preventive care actions were analyzed. This was true even though most physicians endorsed providing most kinds of preventive care for hospitalized patients. Conclusions: Despite past success in increasing preventive care in the outpatient setting, we were unable, using a moderately intensive intervention, to increase the provision of preventive care during hospitalizations. The physicians providing care during the hospitalization were not the patients' primary care physicians, which proved to be an important barrier.

Methods: Randomized study with health center as unit. General practice in Sor- and Nord-Trondelag counties in Norway, 380,000 inhabitants. Seventeen health centers with 24 doctors and 499 patients with diabetes mellitus were in the intervention group and 12 health centers with 29 doctors and 535 patients were in the control group. Main outcome measures were group differences in fractions of patients without registrations (process evaluation) and mean group differences for the same variables (patient outcome evaluation). Results: Statistically significant group differences were experienced for fractions of patients without registration of cigarette smoking (intervention group, 82.6%; control group 94.5%), body mass index (78.2% vs. 93.0%), and sufficient registrations for calculation of risk score for myocardial infarction (91.1% vs. 98.3%); all during 18 months.

The Computer-based Clinical Decision Support System provides an opportunity to close these gaps. Objectives: To study the impact of computerized intervention on secondary prevention of CAD. Methods: The CDSS was programmed to automatically detect patients with CAD and to evaluate the availability of an updated lipoprotein profile and treatment with lipid-lowering drugs. The program produced automatic computer-generated monitoring and treatment recommendations. Adjusted primary clinics were randomly assigned to intervention (n=56) or standard care arms (n=56). Reminders were mailed to the primary medical teams in the intervention arm every 4 months updating them with current lipid levels and recommendations for further treatment. Compliance and lipid levels were monitored. The study group comprised all patients with CAD who were alive at least 3 months after hospitalization. Results: follow-up was available for 7448 patients (median 19.8 months, range 6-36 months), Overall, 51.7% of patients were adequately screened, and 55.7% of patients were compliant with treatment to lower lipid level. In patients with initial low density lipoprotein > 120 mg/dl, a significant decrease in LDL levels was observed in both arms, but was more pronounced in the intervention arm: 121.9 +/- 34.2 vs. 124.3 +/- 34.6 mg/dl (P < 0.02). A significantly lower rate of cardiac rehospitalizations was documented in patients who were adequately treated with lipid-lowering drugs, 37% vs. 40.9% (P < 0.001). Conclusions: This initial assessment of our data represent a real-world snapshot where physicians and CAD patients often do not adhere to clinical guidelines, presenting a major obstacle to implementing effective secondary prevention.

Differences between guideline recommendations and actual frequency of therapeutic laboratory monitoring are substantial. This study evaluated interventions to improve laboratory monitoring at initiation of medication therapy. Methods: This cluster-randomized trial compared 3 interventions to usual care for 10 medications in 15 primary care clinics in a health maintenance organization with an electronic medical record system. Eligible patients, identified from electronic databases, had not received recommended laboratory monitoring within 5 days after new dispensing of a study medication. Interventions were an electronic medical record reminder to the prescribing health care professional, an automated voice message to the patient, and a pharmacy team outreach to the patient. Primary outcome was completion of all recommended baseline laboratory monitoring. Results: A total of 961 patients participated in the study. At 25 days, 95 (48.5%) of 196 patients in the electronic medical record reminder group, 177 (66.3%) of 267 in the automated voice message group, 214 (82.0%) of 261 in the pharmacy team outreach group, and 53 (22.4%) of 237 in the usual care group had completed all recommended baseline laboratory monitoring (P <.001). After adjustments, the hazard ratios for completing laboratory monitoring compared with usual care were 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.8-3.5) for electronic medical record reminder, 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 3.0-5.6) for automated voice message, and 6.7 (95% confidence interval, 4.9-9.0) for pharmacy team outreach.

Study design and perspective: A cluster-randomized, unblinded, pragmatic trial was conducted. To assess the impact in effectiveness and costs of a CDSS implementing an adapted version of the ESCHM recommendations, a parallel comparison with a usual care group was carried out over 1 year. The recruitment period started in April 2000 and ended 1 year later. Effectiveness was defined as the achievement of the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction goals in patients with initial cardiovascular risk (CVR) > 20% over 10 years (the goals being LDL-C < 115 mg/dL for patients with coronary heart disease [CHD], or LDL-C < 130 mg/dL for patients without CHD), or keeping CVR < 20% at study end in patients with initial CVR < 20%. The costs of treatments, visits, and laboratory assessments were estimated from the social perspective (year of costing 2002). Methods: The ESCHM guidelines adapted by a steering committee included therapeutic recommendations directed to achieve LDL-C objectives in a cost-effective manner. To promote healthy cardiovascular lifestyles, items such as table cloths and magnets for the refrigerator (with relevant promotional messages) were distributed to intervention practices. All study physicians recorded the patients' data in a specific-purpose application installed on their computer. In the case of intervention physicians, the CDSS was installed as an additional module of this application and they were requested to use it but were otherwise free to adopt or ignore the recommendations. Adherence to the guideline was monitored by the CDSS. Patients with hypercholesterolemia were selected from 44 general practices in Spain, mainly in the Catalonia region. Main outcome measures and results: 2221 patients were included in the study (1161 in usual care group and 1060 in the intervention group). The intervention was shown to be as effective as usual care, both in an unadjusted analysis and after adjusting for absolute CVR and previous treatment with lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs) [odds ratio (OR) 1.02; 95% Cl 0.58, 1.77]. The intervention had no impact on lipid profiles. Intervention patients were prescribed LLDs less frequently than usual care patients (OR = 0.37; 95% Cl 0.26, 0.52; p = 0.0001), particularly when CVR was low. This induced important savings in treatments (p = 0.0001) and total costs (p = 0.001), which were estimated as 24.9% and 20.8%, respectively.

Methods: We recruited 68 primary care family and internal medicine practices; 66 were randomly allocated to a study arm; 5 practices withdrew, resulting in 29 receiving the Third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) intervention and 32 receiving an alternative intervention focused on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7). The ATP III providers received a personal digital assistant providing the Framingham risk scores and ATP III-recommended treatment. All practices received copies of each clinical practice guideline, an introductory lecture, 1 performance feedback report, and 4 visits for intervention-specific academic detailing.
